What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It has no commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the set of files waiting to be commited - it helps you keep 
track of the changes in the next commit.
Working directory is a OS structure.
Repository contains all the tracked files in the working directory and their 
history.
