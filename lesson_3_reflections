When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share code with other people or to work on multiple devices; also for back-up purposes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

It's better to control what code enters in your local version; you can currently work on a feature on
a branch and maybe somebody commits code related to the same feature (in the same branch) in the remote 
and conflicts with your code.
